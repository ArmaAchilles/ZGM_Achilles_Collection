<br/> 
<font color='#808080'>Please follow these rules whilst on the server. This may appear to be your typical public Zeus server, but we do enforce our rules and want to keep it as a fun, peaceful place to coordinate and play in.</font color> 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>1. </font color>Be respectful.</font size> 
<br/><font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Do not disrespect others over age, race, gender, nationality or play-style issues. Be constructive.</font color></font size> 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>2. </font color>Don't troll.</font size> 
<br/><font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Do not purposefully destroy mission assets and equipment to disrupt the mission. Do not fire around civilian targets or other entities to cause them to flee, that is disruptive. Do not irritate other players.</font color></font size> 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>3. </font color>Do not hijack the Zeus slot.</font size> 
<br/><font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>If a Zeus accidentally crashes, a grace period of 10 minutes will be given for them to be able to rejoin. We may also kick inactive Zeuses if they are not actively creating a mission.</font color></font size> 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>4. </font color>Do not team-kill.</font size><br/> 
<font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Do not teamkill your squadmates. If you are a teamkiller, your squadmates are allowed to kill you in defense.</font color></font size> 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>5. </font color>Do not abuse Zeus.</font size> 
<br/><font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Do not use Zeus to ruin the experience for other players. Balance the experience, and do not overpower the players, just because they won't do the mission they way you want them to. Zeus experiences should not be linear.</font color></font size> 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>6. </font color>Wear proper equipment.</font size> 
<br/><font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Wear the right faction uniform and equipment to avoid miscommunication. Wear the right kit for the right job.</font color></font size> 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>7. </font color>Stick to the mission.</font size> 
<br/><font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Bring the right equipment. Do not use OP gear such as thermals or anti-materiel rifles unless permitted by the Zeus.</font color></font size> 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>8. </font color>English Only.</font size> 
<br/><font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Please speak English on the server if you are with English-speaking players. It is disrespectful to speak another language in the presence of someone who does not know it, and also complicates moderation, even if in direct chat.</font color></font size> 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>9. </font color>Regulate your kit and stick to your role.</font size> 
<br/><font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Use common sense to wear and use appropriate items, equipment and weaponry. For example, wear a pilot's outfit or crewman outfit if you intend to be a pilot or tank crewman. Do not run around in full infantry kit and then fly a helicopter.</font color></font size> 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>10. </font color>Zeus makes the mission.</font size> 
<br/><font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Listen to Zeus. Do not tell Zeus what to do, instead provide suggestions. Abide by what Zeus asks you to do or wear and do not excessively beg Zeus to give you armored or aerial vehicles. However, players are allowed to politely provide suggestions for a mission, and Zeus must respect that as well. If the Zeus is making an unsatisfactory experience, or the mission is nonsensical, this rule automatically doesn't apply.</font color></font size> 
 
<br/><br/> 
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>11. </font color>Listen to the squad-leader.</font size> 
<br/><font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Listen to your squad-leader. The squad-leader will dictate the resources required for the mission as well as the roles they require. They will also dedicate certain tasks to people, so please listen to them.</font color></font size><br/><br/>

<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>12. </font color>Understand fair remote control use</font size><br/> <font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Using remote control to unfairly punish players in situations where the AI would not know their position or state (but the Zeus does) is not allowed either. Remote Control should not ruin the experience of the player, and they should be able to understand the reason of why they were killed. Remote Control is better used to perform specific actions that do not involve outright killing players, e.g. suppressive fire.</font color></font size> 

<br/><br/>
 
<font size='20'><font color='#67b4fb'>13. </font color>Do not represent controversial subjects</font size><br/> <font size='15'><font color='#ffa500'>Controversial subjects that have occurred in real life may not be represented in-game, in any shape or form, no exceptions.</font color></font size>
